The goal of our CURIS project this summer was to add low-power wireless networking support to the Tock operating system. Tock is a secure embedded OS designed for the future of the Internet of Things (IoT), when embedded devices will run multiple concurrent, mutually distrustful applications on a single embedded device. This summer we were tasked with enabling IPv6 packet transmission and reception over IEEE 802.15.4, a technical standard for low-power wireless networks that specifies the physical (Layer 1) and data link (Layer 2) layers.  While network (Layer 3) protocols for the IoT have been defined on paper, the IoT is still young, and a de facto L3 standard has not yet been set. [Need 6LoWPAN for IPv6]. To motivate the implementation of 6LoWPAN, we chose to follow the Thread networking protocol developed by Nest Labs, which defines a mesh network that uses 6LoWPAN and 802.15.4.

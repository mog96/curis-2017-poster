The goal of our CURIS project this summer was to add low-power wireless networking support to the Tock operating system. Tock is a secure embedded OS designed for the future of the Internet of Things (IoT), when embedded devices will run multiple concurrent, mutually distrustful applications on a single embedded device.
We were tasked with enabling IPv6 packet transmission over a low-rate (and hence, low-power) wireless personal area network (WPAN), the type of network (Layer 3) used to connect IoT devices. The most widely adopted standard in the IoT space is IEEE 802.15.4, which specifies the physical (Layer 1) and data link (Layer 2) layers that support a WPAN. A number of network (Layer 3) protocols have been defined on top of IEEE 802.15.4, but because the IoT is still young, a de facto L3 standard has not yet been set. So far, only one such network protocol has been defined with IPv6 in mind: Thread, created by Nest Labs. The Thread protocol makes use of 6LoWPAN, a compression scheme defined by the IETF that allows IPv6 packets to be fragmented and sent over an IEEE 802.15.4 based network.
